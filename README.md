<h1 id="Apple-2014-clon">Apple's 2014 homepage clon</h1>

<p>Fourth project of the <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> curriculum from the CSS3 and HTML section.</p>

<p>In this project we cloned the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. It’s not a very complex site but it uses background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient to mimic.</p>

<p>You can look at the original site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/">here</a>.</p>
