<h1 id="Apple-2014-clon">Apple's 2014 homepage clon</h1>

<p>Second project of the <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> curriculum from the CSS3 and HTML section.</p>

<p>In this project we cloned the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. It’s not a very complex site but it uses background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient to mimic.</p>
